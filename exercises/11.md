I like the Ruby Cheat Sheet (http://overapi.com/ruby/) the best because it has all of the 
methods, classes, modules, etc. linked to on a single page that is searchable and attractively presented. Each link takes you to the relevant section of ruby-doc.org. I hope they update the
links to a newer version of ruby though because currently it links to the docs for Ruby 1.9.3.
