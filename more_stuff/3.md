Exception handling lets you tell ruby what to do if there is an error when running the
code. By using the reserved words begin and rescue, you tell ruby to run the code in
rescue if the code after begin creates an error. Exception handling solves the problem
of what a program should do when there is an error. If there were no exception handling, 
the program would stop running when there was an exception. Exception handling is 
especially important when taking user input and when you might have a case of dividing 
by 0 or interacting with nil.
